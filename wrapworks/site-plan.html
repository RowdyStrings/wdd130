      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <p>WrapWorks will not only be your go to website to order vinyl wraps for your vehicle, 
        but we will also make sure to leave a lasting impression that will make you come back to the website
        and order some more wraps, whether they are meant for you, members of your family, or even friends.</p>
        <h3>First-time visit.</h3>
        <p>When our guests first visit our website they will be warmly greeted and afterwards,
        we will provide a prompt on their screen to ask them what kind of vehicle they are looking 
        to apply our wraps on, and what their color preference of choice will be.</p>
        <h3>Our home-page.</h3>
        <p>There will be plenty of subpages four our website guests to choose from in our 
        navitagion menu, which is esentially our home page.
        These subpages will consist of a page to place orders with the current shopping cart, 
        a page where we will list all of our available products, a page that will allow 
        guests to contact us via a telephone line or e-mail, and an about us page where we 
        describe our roots and why we do what we do.</p>
        <h3>Placing an order with us.</h3>
        <p>When guests feel like they are ready to place an order, they will click on the shopping
        cart icon to review the products they are purchasing from our selection. Once they have
        fully reviwed the products within the shopping cart, they will click on the "Proceed
        to checkout" button which will redirect them to a page that will prompt them for their
        desired method of payment. And lastly, once our guest has completed the checkout process, 
        they will be redirected to a "Thank you page," that will warmly thank them for doing
        business with us and a side note we will list other products that we think they might
        like or other products that are ordered along with their respective product,
        for example, we can recommend a colored vinyl that complements the colored vinyl they chose.</p>
        <h3>Our Products.</h3>
        <p>This page will simply consist of all the products we will be offering to our guests
        based on subjective categories. Later on, once we have received orders from a variety of customers, 
        we will design a product subpage that will display our frequently bought products.</p>
        <h3>Contact Us.</h3>
        <p>This page will allow guests to reach out to us if they have any questions or inquiries.
        Guests will be able to reach out to us via a telephone line or e-mail. And later on,
        it's planned to implement a live-chat feature that can assist customers with their orders.</p>
        <h3>What is WrapWorks? </h3>
        <p>This page will provide all the information about what we do, who we are, and why we do it.</p>
