    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Brandon Jimenez. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. 
    I grew up in the northern side of New Jersey, right next to New York and the beautiful Hudson River. 
    I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for over a decade.
    I'm Ecuadorian and one of my favorite dishes is Papas con Cuero. My hobbies include powerlifting, gaming, 
    and reading. I look forward to learning with you all. Here's a picture of me and my puppy :)</p>
