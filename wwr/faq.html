            <p>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</p>
                <p>This absolutely is a good trip for children. However, children over the age of 8 seem to 
                enjoy it more overall. A common concern parents have is that their children might be 
                bored for hours at a time. Surprisingly, this couldn't be further from the case. 
                The areas we are rafting through are some of the most stunning in the world, and you never 
                know what you might see around any corner. And the rapids, which keep things interesting. 
                A guide will also be present in each boat.</p>

            <p>Is whitewater rafting safe? Is knowing how to swim a requirement?</p>
                <p class="answer">To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and all 
                start off with at least 3 years of rafting experience. Everyone on commercial rafting trips 
                wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation devices (PFD). Many non swimmers 
                have a great time on rafting trips. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety 
                talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in emergency events.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>What is included in the trip?</p>
                <p>We will provide you with necessary camping equipment. This includes sleeping bags, 
                waterproof duffle bags and small bags, a tent with a cot, eating utensils and camping 
                chairs. We provide water and fresh lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate 
                are provided in the mornings. Alcoholic beverages are allowed in reasonable amounts (2 cans per day).</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>What do I need to bring?</p>
                <p>We suggest to be prepared for both hot & dry or rainy weather. Quick dry shirts, long sleeve 
                cotton shirts and pants to keep you cooler on warm days. Button down shirts provide sun protection 
                on the neck. Men are suggested to wear polypropylene long underwear. Women are suggested to wear 
                swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer. Over the base layer, wear 
                a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if cold, cotton if warm).
                Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or using the bathroom. For headwear, large brim 
                hats offer sun protection. Sunglasses with strap socks, which used for hiking and to protect your 
                feet from the sun. Sandals or water shoes. If they're uncomfortable, bring a pair of shoes you have 
                hiked in before. Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. You may bring something comfortable 
                to sleep in. We suggest you bring small water bottle packs for hikes, moisturizing lotion, a headlamp 
                or flashlight, waterproof sunscreen and lip balm.

            <p>How far in advance should I book my trip?</p>
                <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be flexible,  
                6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
